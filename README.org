* An introductory GW talk

 This talk was created using mostly default configurations from [[https://revealjs.com/][revealjs]] and the Org-mode
 package [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][org-reveal]]. I have also attempted to make a /purely functional/ presentation
 using the Racket package [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/slideshow/][Slideshow]]. Aside the intellectual challenge, the task 
 required long hours of documentation dive-in, making it unsuitable for the scope of the talk.
